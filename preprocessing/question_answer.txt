Admission to Manipal Institute of Technology is through the Manipal Entrance Test (MET), which replaced the Manipal University Online Entrance Test (MU OET) for and beyond and is carried out at centers across India. It is a computer-based exam and consists of questions testing Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, English, and Logical Reasoning and spans a duration of 2 hours and 30 minutes. The test is for 200 marks, +4 for every correct answer and -1 for every wrong one. MAHE offers two opportunities for a student to write the entrance exam, subject to additional payment and availability of vacancies. The format was changed and the test now has 200 questions and the total maximum marks are 800.

Formula Manipal is a student initiative aiming to conceive, design, fabricate, develop, and compete with other formula-style vehicles at international Formula Student events. They built a cc race car that was selected to participate in the Formula SAE competition organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers held at Ferrari Race Track at Maranello in Italy, an international race car design competition attended by universities from across the world. In , the team participated with the second prototype at FS UK, held at the Silverstone F track. ThrustMIT is one of the countryâ€™s first rocketry teams. The team aims to foster interest and innovation in the field of rocketry.

The modus operandi at ThrustMIT involves providing team members with hands-on experience in this field, allowing them to improve and learn on the job, which ultimately aids them in supporting the teamâ€™s endeavors. Project Manas is another initiative by students and is an AI robotics team that was founded in the year . They have taken part in India's biggest driverless car challenge - "Spark The Rise" - organized by Mahindra. The team qualified for three stages and is one of the top teams to qualify for the prototyping phase.

The prototype is capable of detecting and navigating around pedestrians, a variety of traffic signs and signals, road and non-road regions, vehicles along with a wide range of other obstacles. AeroMIT is a student project aiming towards aeromodelling and drone research. They design and fabricate RC and autonomous aerial vehicles for competition as well as research purposes. The year - was one of the most successful years for the team. They secured podium positions in national competitions like Aerophilia and Techfest, . The team also secured world rank in their flagship competition SAE Aerodesign East held in Lakeland, Florida. Other than that, the team secured world rank in the category of oral presentation by scoring the highest points in the history of the competition and was also the only team to lift the maximum possible payload.

In , following aggressive protests by the students of the Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT), the director, Kum Kum Garg, resigned from her post. The protesting students had demanded the resignation of the director for her alleged insensitive remarks over the death of a student in a bus accident. In March, MIT required students to download a software called Pexa Lite on their laptops, to conduct proctored end-semester exams. On installing the software, some students complained of their laptops slowing or crashing due to malware. In February, the students of MIT were called back to campus for the offline end-semester examinations.

But on March, offline classes were canceled due to the rising number of COVID- cases on campus. By the first week of April, over students of MIT were infected by the coronavirus due to poor social distancing and lax safety standards in the college. In the last week of May, MIT released a revised schedule for the upcoming months. This was a very chaotic, tough schedule. This caused outrage amongst the students, who were already not pleased with the college due to unpopular decisions taken by them over the course of the pandemic. The protests by the students of MIT were initially ignored by the administration of MIT and MAHE. But, on June, MIT cancelled the end-semester examinations and opted to prorate the marks based on previous semester performances.
